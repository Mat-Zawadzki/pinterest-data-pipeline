# Pinterest Data Pipeline
Firstly, I got my hands on some infrastructure similar to that which I would be working with were I a data engineer working at Pinterest.

Inside I found user_posting_emulation.py, that contains the login credentials for a RDS database, which contains three tables with data resembling data received by the Pinterest API when a POST request is made by a user uploading data to Pinterest:
- pinterest_data contains data about posts being updated to Pinterest
- geolocation_data contains data about the geolocation of each Pinterest post found in pinterest_data
- user_data contains data about the user that has uploaded each post found in pinterest_data
You can run the provided script and print out pin_result, geo_result and user_result to get familiar with the data the same way I did.
